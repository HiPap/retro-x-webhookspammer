This software is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES! By using this software you are responsible for your own actions not the creator. I am a person who likes to make these type of projects
for fun nothing more, I test these types of projects in a Windows 10 VM or if its a tool like hilinux, Kali Linux.

Pull requests are welcome as I want to improve this software for the fun of it. I see it as nothing more than a hobby project. I don't intend on causing harm to others. If there is any major changes you would like to do
or potentially work with me add me on my Discord
